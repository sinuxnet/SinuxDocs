# API and Web Service Introduction

## 1. API

### 1.1 - What is an API?

API is an acronym.

* **A (Application):** Software that does a task

* **P (Programming):**  Program (P) that does the task in the Application (A)

* **I (Interface):** Place (I) to tell the program (P) to run

An API exists where you can tell (I) a computer program (p) to run in an application (A).

In other words, you tell a program to run s.th which you don't own it.

What makes APIs great?

* Just use the program don't write it!

* Platform independent

* Upgrade safe

### 1.2 API Excercise

**Interface(I):** From where are you telling the program what to run?

**Program(P):** What task is being done/what does program d?

**Application(A):** What software has the program being run?

| Level of Difficulty | Example                                              | I (Interface)      | P (Program)  | A (Application) |
|:-------------------:| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Simple              | Viber message using cell phone                       | Cell phone         | Messaging    | Viber           |
| Simple              | google search using computer                         | Computer(Broweser) | Search       | Google          |
| Moderate            | Create orders in eBay when you get them (no Browser) | eBay               | Create order | eBay            |
| Moderate            | Create order in SAP when you get them (no Browser)   | SAP                | Create order | SAP             |

### 1.3 API Details

3 things happen in every API transaction:

1. **Request:** A request is made fo something to be done.

2. **Program:** A program is run to complete that requset.

3. **Response:** Sending Back response.

Example:

In browser(http client): 

Â Â Â Â www.google.com/search?q=tuna

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â q: search term (query)

Â Â Â Â www.google.com/searrch?tbm=isch&q=tuna

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â tbm: To Be Matched

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â isch: Image Search

## 2. Web Service

### 2.1 What is a web service?

**Web:** internet

**Service:** API

**Web Service:** API that uses the internet

:memo: So, all web services is an API.

:bulb: But not all APIs are web services. Not all APIs use the internet.

Web Services use:

* **XML** or **JSON** to format data over the internet.

* REST, SOAP, or XML/RPC to transfer that data.

## 3. HTTP

### 3.1 Introduction to HTTP

**HTTP:** HyperText Transfer Protocol

* **HyperText**
  
  * What does regular text do? Nothong
  
  * HTTP make the text special in order to hyper(send) to somewhere else. 

HTTP request & response includes:

1. **Start line** (Mandatory) 

2. **Headers** 

3. **Blank Line** (Just seperate headers from body)

4. **Body**

| HTTP           | Request                                                        | Response                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Start Line     | HTTP **Version** (v1.1)Â <br>**Method** (GET,POST, PUT, DELETE) | HTTP Version (v1.1)Â <br>**Status Code** |
| Header<u>s</u> | HOST: url.domain.com, Token: xxxxxx                            | Cookie1, Cookie2                        |
| Blank Line     |                                                                |                                         |

##### 3.2.1.3 What is idempotence?

Can do as many times as you want and result stay the same.

In other words: **Safe** to repeat

| GET    | Yes                        |
| POST   | No                         |

#### 3.2.2 HTTP Headers

##### 3.2.2.1 Request fields

**Accept-Language:** List of acceptable human languages for response

**Authorization:** Authentication credentials forÂ [HTTP authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

**Host:** The domain name of the server (forÂ [virtual hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting "Virtual hosting")), and theÂ [TCP port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers "List of TCP and UDP port numbers")Â number on which the server is listening. TheÂ [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking) "Port (computer networking)")Â number may be omitted if the port is the standard port for the service requested. Mandatory since HTTP/1.1.

##### 3.2.2.2 Response field

**Cache-Control:** Tells all caching mechanisms from server to client whether they may cache this object. It is measured in seconds.
